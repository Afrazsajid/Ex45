//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name..

let friends = ["Nisar","Mehak","Tasbiha"]
let message="hey,how are you doing?"
console.log(message,friends[0])
console.log(message,friends[1])
console.log(message,friends[2])
